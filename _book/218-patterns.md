There are a number of patterns using in OSGi systems.

## Whiteboard Pattern

The Service Whiteboard pattern is useful when you need register with another party and the presence of that other party does not forbid you to make progress. Most OSGi Services except the first few are designed according to the whiteboard model.

In a collaboration model there are multiple parties that interact. In general, this interaction goes into a certain direction. For example, in Event Admin the sender depends on the Event Admin service. It needs the Event Admin interface to send or post an event. In a more traditional model the Event Handler would have to be explicitly registered with the Evenet Admin service. In this vein, a implementation of the Event Handler would have to get the Event Admin service and add itself as listener.

In an OSGi system this 'listener' model is not recommended because it is more work, it has many potential problems in a dynamic world, and the service registry is a much more powerful and robust (concurrent) mechanism to handle these 'listeners' than that what most providers are willing to provide as registry. And last but not least, there is a free introspection API that is used by all OSGi debugging tools.

Using the service registry allows the use of service properties to provide meta data for the service. For example, in Event Admin an Event Handler specifies the topic and filter as service properties. These are picked up by the Event Admin implementation and used to filter the events that are send towards the handler.

Just an overview of where the Whiteboard Pattern is used in the OSGi services:

* Http Service – Allows Servlets & Filters to be registered as service.
* Event Admin – The Event Handler service receives all events once it is registered.
* Framework hooks – Registering a Bundle or Service Hook service will automatically activate them.
* Configuration Admin – The Managed Service and Managed Service Factory are whiteboard as well as the Configuration Listener.
* User Admin – The User Admin Event Listener service receives any User Admin related events.
* Deployment Admin – The Resource Processor services are whiteboard.
* Repository – To make a repository available it is only necesssary to register them.
* etc. etc.
 
Novice OSGi users often feel uncomfortable publicly registering these listeners. There are performance fears and a feeling of being unprotected. Performance is not an issue since there have been tests with hundreds of thousands of services without any noticeable degradation. The feeling of being vulnerable will go away once you see how the service in a service registry are collaborating.

Clearly the pattern is common and popular because is so easy to. Virtually all OSGi services after release 1 are based on this model. Any occasion where you want to establish a channel of event like objects then the whiteboard should be used. 

### Example

This example shows a skeleton of a service that listens to a white board service.

	package com.acme.server;
	
	@Component
	public class TickerImpl{
	
		@Reference(policy=DYNAMIC)
		final List<Tick> ticks = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();
		
		private Closeable schedule;
		
		@Reference
		void setScheduler( Scheduler scheduler ) {
			schedule = scheduler.schedule( () -> {
				ticks.stream().forEach( t -> t.tick() );
			}, 1000);
		}
	}


	package com.acme.client;
	@Component
	public class TickWhiteboardImpl implements Tick {
		public void tick() {
			System.out.println("I am here!");
		}
	} 
	
## Extender Pattern

The Extender Pattern is useful when you find that bundles have to repeat the same boiler plate code or resources to function. With the bundles only provide the unique part and any shared/common parts are provided by another, shared, bundle. The _extender_ is the bundle that operates on behalf of an _extendee_, the bundle that contains the unique parts. Extenders generally define a manifest header or magic directory to allow an extendee to opt-in.  

For example, the Declarative Services specification defines an _extender_ model. A component provides an XML file inside its bundle (generated by the annotations) that is read by the extender bundle when the component bundle gets started. This extender bundle then does all the boiler plate code to register services, check dependencies, handler configuration, and many tasks you don't want to know about.

The benefit is that the extender allows a 'declarative' model, which is usually smaller and more concise extendees.

The extender model works in OSGi because the bundle life cycle is well defined and evented. An extender bundle can listen to the installation of a new bundle as well detect that bundles are/have been uninstalled. It can therefore actively scope its utility around the life cycle of the extendee. For example, Declarative Services will wait to activate components until their bundles' are started. 
 
One of the primary goals of the extender pattern is to allow bundles to be self contained. A hard problem in system deployment is that systems consist often of so many parts that can reside in quite a few places. Orchestrating all these parts is surprisingly difficult. Not just during an install, also during the uninstall of a module. Having a unified deployment artifact for code, resources, and configuration therefore simplifies the deployment phase.

Bundles are excellent artifacts for virtually anything that can be represented as a resource/file since they are based on the ZIP format with a manifest. What the purpose is of a particular resource is in the eye of the beholder. Class files are code, but this is an interpretation of the VM. A manifest is paramount for OSGi but is interpreted by the framework. The VM and the OSGi framework are given, however, their strategy to look inside the ZIP file to find things they know can easily be extended in an OSGi system by allowing all bundles to look inside any other bundle. Since the framework sends out events when the life cycle state of a bundle changes, it is quite easy to track the state of other bundles. (The Bundle Tracker actually makes this trivial.)

The following OSGi service specifications are extenders:

* Declarative Services – The Service-Component manifest header points to the XML files containing the component descriptions.
* OSGi JPA – The Persistence header identifies the presence of a persistence.xml file that identifies the persistence objects.
* Metatype – The Metatype service can find metatype definitions inside bundles.
* Remote Service Admin – The RSA Endpoint discovery model can detect endpoint definitions in bundles.
