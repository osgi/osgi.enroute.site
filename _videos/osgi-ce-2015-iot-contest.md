summary: A short video showing the emulator and the train used during the OSGi CE 2015 IoT Contest 
---

At the OSGi CE 2015 at the EclipseCon in Ludwigsburg, Germany, the OSGi Alliance held an IoT contest. Using OSGi enRoute, contestants could use an SDK to write either a Train or Track Manager. These bundles could be tested with a software emulator. During the Community Event, the Alliance installed an actual Lego train that was controlled by a cloud server and multiple Raspberry Pi's. The winner was Ghislain Nadeau and it is his bundle controlling the train in the video. Congratulations!

We are planning to move the contest [SDK to a tutorial][1].
