			<p>
				OSGi is <em>arguably</em> the best way to develop software systems
				and take advantage of modularity. However, until now the threshold
				to get started was high due to lack of a good tool chain, proper
				service based libraries, and tutorials, with the consequence that
				many people gave up before the benefits became visible.
			<p>The vision of the OSGi Alliance with the enRoute project is
				therefore to make OSGi as easy as possible for developers to get
				started with OSGi without compromising its core values.

			<ul>
				<li><b>Community</b> – A growing community 
				<li><b>Programming Model</b> – A best practice µservice based
					development model
				<li><b>Tool Chain</b> – A selected tool chain that supports the
					intended use of the OSGi programming model over all the stages of
					development.
				<li><b>Profiles</b> – A mechanism for creating sets of service
					contracts and capabilities so that developers can decouple
					themselves from implementation details. Currently there is one
					profile, the base profile.
				<li><b>Handbook</b> – TBD
				<li><b>Education</b> – A (hopefully growing) number of
					tutorials.
