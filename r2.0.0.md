title: Release 2.0.0 Information
---

OSGi enRoute is an ongoing project that normally increments in minor version
changes. However, OSGi enRoute is this time a major version because we 
made a lot of changes to the underlying machinery.

For the use of OSGi enRoute there is not much difference. However, under the 
cover we've made it possible to share repositories between Maven and Bndtools
and we phased out the use of JPM in favor of defining external dependencies
in a Maven POM.

OSGi enRoute requires Bndtools 3.3.0 or later.  

The [tutorials] have been adapted to the new release and an app note was created
to describe the release of OSGi enRoute to Maven.

From the OSGi enRoute bundles there have not been major changes. The biggest change
has been in the web server support (static resource, web resources, caching) that now
also supports the concept of a conditional servlet. A servlet that allows to reply
with a false when called and when it cannot handle the URI. The REST support
has also undergone a number of changes and supports an experimental implementation
of the draft 3.0 OpenAPI.
